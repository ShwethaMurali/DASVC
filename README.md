# DASVC
A tool for calling SVs from genome-wide contig alignments to a reference genome genome alignments.

# Dependancies (for the full pipeline)

The dependancies are only required if you'd like to run the whole pipeline.  Otherwise, you can build you own netted SAM file and run the last step.

1. [LASTZ](http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/dist/README.lastz-1.02.00/README.lastz-1.02.00a.html). For aligning contigs to a reference genome.
2. [LAST](http://last.cbrc.jp). Conversion from MAF to SAM
3. [UCSC](https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/kentUtils/tree/master/src). File conversion, chaining and netting.
3. [SNAKEMAKE](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home). Running the pipeline.

# Annotations added to BAM file

1. "QS" Query start
2. "QE" Query end
2. "QL" Query length 
3. "MB" Number matching bases in block (=|M)
4. "PI" Percent identity 
5. "BI" Block ID (equivalent to query name)
6. "AI" Alignment block ID sorted by query start "QS"
7. "NB" The number of aligment blocks for the query sequence
8. "TM" Total matching bases in query sequence
9. "FA" Special field. The QS,QE, and strand for the query before and after the current alignment (sorted by query start).
